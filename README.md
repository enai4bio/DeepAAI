## A Novel Deep Learning Method for Identifying Antigen-Antibody Interactions (DeepAAI)

DeepAAI is an advanced deep learning-based tool for identifying antigen-antibody interactions.

For making DeepAAI available at no cost to the community, we have set a **[web service](https://aai-test.github.io/)** predicting antigen-antibody interactions.

### Architecture

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
Before training, all the files (```*.7z```) in the ```dataset/corpus/processed_mat/``` need to be decompressed. These decompressed files are processed datasets which are the input of the models.

Execute the following scripts to train antigen-antibody neutralization model with kmer features on the HIV dataset.
```bash
python model_trainer/deep_aai_kmer_embedding_cls_trainer.py --mode train
```

Execute the following scripts to train antigen-antibody IC50 prediction model with kmer features on the HIV dataset.
```bash
python model_trainer/deep_aai_kmer_embedding_reg_trainer.py --mode train
```

Execute the following scripts to train antigen-antibody neutralization model with kmer and pssm features on the HIV dataset.
```bash
python model_trainer/deep_aai_kmer_pssm_embedding_cls_trainer.py --mode train
```

```

```bash
python model_trainer/baseline_parapred_reg_trainer.py --mode train
```





### Preprocessing dataset
The data pre-processing module is in the folder of ```processing/```. There are three sub-folders in the processing folder, ```hiv_cls```, ```hiv_reg```, and ```cov_cls```.

- ```hiv_cls``` includes the scripts and the source data that generate the dataset for HIV classification. The source file is ```dataset_hiv_cls.xlsx```, which contains four fields ```antibody_seq```, ```virus_seq```, ```label```, and ```split```. ```processing/hiv_cls/corpus/cls``` contains data indices. The generated  dataset for HIV classification will be under ```processing/hiv_cls/corpus/processed_mat```. 

- ```hiv_reg``` includes the scripts and the source data that generate the dataset for HIV regression. The source file is ```dataset_hiv_reg.xlsx```, which contains four fields ```antibody_seq```, ```virus_seq```, ```label```, and ```split```. ```processing/hiv_cls/corpus/cov_cls``` contains data indices. The generated dataset for HIV regression will be under ```processing/hiv_reg/corpus/processed_mat```. 

- ```cov_cls``` includes the scripts and the source data that generate the dataset for SARS-CoV2 classification. The source file is ```dataset_cov_cls.xlsx```, which contains four fields ```antibody_seq```, ```virus_seq```, ```label```, and ```split```. ```processing/cov_cls/corpus/cov_cls``` contains data indices. The generated  dataset for HIV regression will be under ```processing/cov_cls/corpus/processed_mat```. 

Under ```processing/hiv_cls/```, ```processing/hiv_reg/```, and ```processing/cov_cls/```, there are ```processing.py```s. Lines 62-82 in each ```processing.py``` correspond to how to convert the sequence into kmer, one-hot, pssm, etc.

- Lines 62-66: one-hot
- Lines 68-69: pssm
- Lines 71-75: amino_num
- Lines 77-82: k-mer-whole

The pssm needs to be obtained from the POSSUM website and placed in the pssm folder. We select the Uniref50 database with the tool of the position-specific scoring matrix-based feature generator for machine learning (POSSUM)(Wang, J. et al. Possum: a bioinformatics toolkit for generating numerical sequence feature descriptors based on pssm profiles. Bioinformatics 33, 2756â€“2758 (2017).) to generate PSSMs.
